# GitHub-Tutorial

Welcome to (possibly) the first repository you will use! Here we will learn how to push and pull using Github desktop. 

Pushing and pulling can result in a merge conflict if the head is moved off the ancestor (learn more about branching with [learngitbranches](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=en_US)). These can result in merge conflicts which we will also explain. 
We will not do a live demo of this.

If you want to commit from CLI do:

git add -A

git commit -m "commit message"

git push

-Oliver
